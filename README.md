# Project Title: CycleSim 
Code to simulate various cyclic adsorption processes
### CycleSim is a simulation model for cyclic adsorption processes and can accommodate pressure swing adsorption, vacuum swing adsorption, temperature swing adsorption or any other hybrid options.  These cyclic processes are used to separate a gas stream of Ngas components into several streams with different compositions.
